## 1. Project1: Build My World

### Goal

Design a Gazebo World environment including multiple models and use it as a base for the rest of my projects.

### What I learned
- Launching a Gazebo Environment
- Designing in Gazebo

## 2. Project2: Go Chase It

### Goal

Design and build a mobile robot, and house it in my world I previously designed. Then, program my robot with C++ nodes in ROS to chase white colored ball.

### What I learned
- Building Catkin Workspaces
- ROS node creation
- ROS node communication
- Using additional ROS packages
- Gazebo world integration
- RViz integration

## 3. Project3: Where Am I?

### Goal

Interface my mobile robot with the Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization algorithm in ROS to estimate my robot's position as it travels through a predefined set of waypoints, and tune different parameters to increase the localization efficiency of the robot.

### What I learned
- Implementation of Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization in ROS
- Understanding of tuning parameters required
